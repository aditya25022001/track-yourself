# track-yourself

Another to do list application

Further step to learning react

Also using firebase as a realtime database

Figuring out if use express or not...??

# TO USE THE APPLICATION FOR PERSONAL USE
* Create a firebase account
* Create a project 
* Inside that create app and register the same
* Go to app settings and grab the config part at the bottom
* Save it to the source folder of react app
* The above step is necessary since each will get personal KEY to the database
* After that go to cloud firestore and create database 
* And you are good to go

Start to check development mode
* npm start
